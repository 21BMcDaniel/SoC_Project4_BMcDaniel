# SoC_Project4_BMcDaniel
Project 4 for systemC and Opencv implementation of Image analysis. This project implements Transaction Level Modeling for the last task to produce a line detection algorithm for a road image.

## **Results**

The final result showed successfully detected road lines in the processed image, with clear edges and well-defined lines. The image processing pipeline was able to effectively detect edges in the full image and focus line detection on the region where road lines typically appear.

## **Screenshots**

- **Original Image**:
  - Screenshot showing the input image before processing.
  
- **Edge Detection**:
  - Screenshot displaying the result of edge detection on the full image.

- **Detected Road Lines**:
  - Screenshot displaying the final result with road lines drawn in red.

## **Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrated how to apply image processing techniques such as edge detection and line detection to detect road lines. By applying both full-image processing and region-specific (ROI) processing, the system was able to focus on the most relevant features. Despite some challenges, such as tuning the parameters for edge and line detection, the final result was a robust solution for detecting road lines in images.
